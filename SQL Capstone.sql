-- MAGIC ## The actual analysis

-- MAGIC Will consist in: <br/>
-- MAGIC 1. Count the number of medals for each sport for three periods: 1972-1984 (average), 1988, 1992-2002 (average), grouped by country. Divide by the number of athletes/teams, and see which countries had the highest growth overall.
-- MAGIC 2. Repeat this analysis at the aggregate region level
-- MAGIC 3. Repeat 1 and 2 with focus on USSR/ex. Soviet (hypothesis)
-- MAGIC 4. Repeat 1 and 2 with focus on Asia (hypothesis)
-- MAGIC 5. Countries with greatest growth in athletes (pre-1988 avg, 1988, post-1988 avg)
-- MAGIC 6. Regression: overall, for each year, is there a link between the number of athletes/teams and the number of medals?
