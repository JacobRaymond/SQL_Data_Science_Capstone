# SQL_Data_Science_Capstone

The Databricks notebook I used for the UC Davis Coursera Course "SQL for Data Science Capstone Project". My goal was to see how countries perform in the Winter Games, prior to, during, and after the 1988 Calgary Olympics. The key metrics I evaluated were medal counts and athletes sent. In addition to looking at per-country data, I analyzed the URSS/ex-Soviet nations and East Asia on their own, to validate some hypotheses I had. I cannot share the data; this upload mostly serves as a proof-of-concept for my SQL coding skills, and problem solving and data science abilities. The code is also somewhat rough as I worked directly off this file.
